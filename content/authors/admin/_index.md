I first fell in love with phonetics in 2013 in an introductory class that was part of my B.A. in Language and Communication. 
After finishing my philological and linguistic undergraduate studies, I came to Munich to study at the Institute of Phonetics and 
Speech Processing. It is here that I am currently pursuing my PhD in phonetics as part of the ERC project "InterAccent" 
supervised by Prof. Jonathan Harrington. My research interests include all facets of sound change as well as computational 
modelling techniques such as agent-based modelling as a method of investigating sound change.
